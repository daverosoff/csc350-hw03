# This is a skeleton for HW 03. You can use these classes as is, or
# change the class structure, but the classes DFA and NFA must have the
# methods listed for parts A and B. You will need to supply the right
# parameters for the included methods, and supply your own definitions
# for the methods in parts C and D.
#
# I have seen that some people will try to make classes for everything:
# states, transitions, etc. This is not necessary. You can do this
# assignment using just the name of the state (as a string) to represent
# it.
